# Explanation of the project
I've developed a note-taking app using Flutter for the frontend and PHP for the backend. The app features user authentication, allowing users to log in and sign up. Once logged in, users can add, delete, and update notes, including attaching images. The app also includes a profile section where users can view their personal information.
